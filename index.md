## Project 1: The Impact of Temperature on the NFL
 - Analyzed impact cold weather had on EPA (expected points added) over the last decade.
 - Used NFL play by play data from nflfastR package in R and joined it with temperature data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
 - Divided teams into cold weather teams and warm weather teams depending on the average temperature of their home city.
 - Also divided games into cold and warm games based on game temperature.
 - Ran a linear regression to estimate EPA/Play using game temperature, wind speed (control), type of game (cold or warm), and type of team (cold or warm).
